## General Tabs Navigation
The day-to-day usage of OpenCTI would involve navigating through different entities within the platform to understand and utilise the information for any threat analysis. We will be looking at the Cobalt Strike malware entity for our walkthrough, mainly found under the Arsenal tab we've covered previously. When you select an intelligence entity, the details are presented to the user through:

### Overview Tab
Provides the general information about an entity being analysed and investigated. In our case, the dashboard will present you with the entity ID, confidence level, description, relations created based on threats, intrusion sets and attack patterns, reports mentioning the entity and any external references.

### Knowledge Tab 
Presents linked information associated with the entity selected. This tab will include the reports associated, indicators, relations and attack pattern timeline of the entity. Additionally, an analyst can view fine-tuned details from the tabs on the right-hand pane, where information about the threats, attack vectors, events and observables used within the entity are presented.

### Indicators Tab
Provides information on IOC identified for all the threats and entities.
### Data Tab 
Contains the files uploaded or generated for export that are related to the entity. These assist in communicating information about threats being investigated in either technical or non-technical formats.
### History Tab 
Changes made to the element, attributes, and relations are tracked by the platform worker and this tab will outline the changes.
