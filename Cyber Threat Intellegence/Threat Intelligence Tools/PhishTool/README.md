Email phishing is one of the main precursors of any cyber attack. Unsuspecting users get duped into the opening and accessing malicious files and links sent to them by email, as they appear to be legitimate. As a result, adversaries infect their victims’ systems with malware, harvesting their credentials and personal data and performing other actions such as financial fraud or conducting ransomware attacks.

PhishTool seeks to elevate the perception of phishing as a severe form of attack and provide a responsive means of email security. Through email analysis, security analysts can uncover email IOCs, prevent breaches and provide forensic reports that could be used in phishing containment and training engagements.

PhishTool has two accessible versions: **Community** and **Enterprise**.

The core features include:

* **Perform email analysis**: PhishTool retrieves metadata from phishing emails and provides analysts with the relevant explanations and capabilities to follow the email’s actions, attachments, and URLs to triage the situation.
* **Heuristic intelligence**: OSINT is baked into the tool to provide analysts with the intelligence needed to stay ahead of persistent attacks and understand what TTPs were used to evade security controls and allow the adversary to social engineer a target.
* **Classification and reporting**: Phishing email classifications are conducted to allow analysts to take action quickly. Additionally, reports can be generated to provide a forensic record that can be shared.

Additional features are available on the Enterprise version:

* Manage user-reported phishing events.
* Report phishing email findings back to users and keep them engaged in the process.
* Email stack integration with Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace.

We are presented with an upload file screen from the Analysis tab on login. Here, we submit our email for analysis in the stated file formats. Other tabs include:

* **History**: Lists all submissions made with their resolutions.
* **In-tray**: An Enterprise feature used to receive and process phish reports posted by team members through integrating Google Workspace and Microsoft 365.
