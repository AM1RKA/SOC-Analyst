Abuse.ch is a research project hosted by the Institue for Cybersecurity and Engineering at the Bern University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland. It was developed to identify and track malware and botnets through several operational platforms developed under the project. These platforms are:

* [**Malware Bazaar**](https://github.com/AM1RKA/SOC-Analyst/tree/main/Cyber%20Threat%20Intellegence/Threat%20Intelligence%20Tools/Abuse.ch/MalwareBazzar):  A resource for sharing malware samples.
* [**Feodo Tracker**](https://github.com/AM1RKA/SOC-Analyst/tree/main/Cyber%20Threat%20Intellegence/Threat%20Intelligence%20Tools/Abuse.ch/FeodoTracker):  A resource used to track botnet command and control (C2) infrastructure linked with Emotet, Dridex and TrickBot.
* [**SSL Blacklist**](https://github.com/AM1RKA/SOC-Analyst/tree/main/Cyber%20Threat%20Intellegence/Threat%20Intelligence%20Tools/Abuse.ch/SSL%20Blacklist):  A resource for collecting and providing a blocklist for malicious SSL certificates and JA3/JA3s fingerprints.
* [**URL Haus**](https://github.com/AM1RKA/SOC-Analyst/tree/main/Cyber%20Threat%20Intellegence/Threat%20Intelligence%20Tools/Abuse.ch/URLhaus):  A resource for sharing malware distribution sites.
* [**Threat Fox**](https://github.com/AM1RKA/SOC-Analyst/tree/main/Cyber%20Threat%20Intellegence/Threat%20Intelligence%20Tools/Abuse.ch/ThreatFox):  A resource for sharing indicators of compromise (IOCs).
