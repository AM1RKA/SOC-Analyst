As the name points out, this tool focuses on sharing malicious URLs used for malware distribution. As an analyst, you can search through the database for domains, URLs, hashes and filetypes that are suspected to be malicious and validate your investigations.

The tool also provides feeds associated with country, AS number and Top Level Domain that an analyst can generate based on specific search needs.
