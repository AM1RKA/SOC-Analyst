## MalwareBazaar
As the name suggests, this project is an all in one malware collection and analysis database. The project supports the following features:

* **Malware Samples Upload**: Security analysts can upload their malware samples for analysis and build the intelligence database. This can be done through the browser or an API.
* **Malware Hunting**: Hunting for malware samples is possible through setting up alerts to match various elements such as tags, signatures, YARA rules, ClamAV signatures and vendor detection.
